# Designers
A guide for designers how to start a new project and how to use the tools in the process.

## Visual Elements
The foundational visual elements of our Koek brands:


- [Colors](colors.md "Colors - Biskit")
- [Typography](typography.md "Typography - Biskit")

## Mechanics
The logic and relationships between spacing, layout, typography, and sizing of all elements:

- [Grid](grid.md "Grid - Biskit")
- [8-pixel Atomic grid](typography.md "Typography - Biskit")

## Tools
To streamline design efforts, share files, and automate as much as possible, we use Sketch. If you’re brand new to Sketch, they offer some [great tutorials and help docs.](https://www.sketch.com/docs/) For more information about how to use Sketch go to the [Sketch workflow](sketch-workflow.md "Sketch workflow - Biskit") page. For you coders out there, we’ve got a robust UI component library built with AngularJS.

## - 1. Install Sketch
To design with Biskit you must have the most recent version of [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) installed.
